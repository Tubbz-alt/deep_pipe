    Parameters
    ----------
    x
        Array with data. Some of it's dimensions are spatial. We extract
        spatial patch specified by spatial location and spatial size.
    spatial_center_idx
        Location of the center of the patch. Components
        correspond to spatial dimensions. If some of patch size components was
        even, patch center is supposed to be on the right center pixel.
    spatial_patch_size
        Spatial patch size. Output will have original shape for
        non-spatial dimensions and patch_size shape for spatial dimensions.
    spatial_dims
        Which of x's dimensions be consider as spatial. Accepts
        negative parameters.
    padding_values
        Defines values, that will fill padding. Have to be broadcastable to
        the resulting patch shape. By default no broadcasting is allowed.
